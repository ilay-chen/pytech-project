Create new react app

// Use https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/users#list-users to get a list of github users
// Each user should display his avatar + name
// Design the card how ever you want
// Initial app state should show the first page of users and when scrolling to end of page 
// more users should be loaded.
// do not use lib for this scroll
// bonus - use mobx and mobx react
